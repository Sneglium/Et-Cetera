<h1> Miscellaneous Utilities </h1>
<hr>
<p>
	Et Cetera contains a number of general-purpose helper functions that don't fit in a specific category; these are detailed here.
	<br>
	<h2>TABLE HELPERS</h2>
	These functions are useful for manipulation of tables without regard to their actual contents.
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.array_find</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.array_find(table, value)</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;If the <code>array</code> contains <code>value</code> as a numerical index, return the index that it is located at; otherwise return <code>nil</code>.
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.flatten</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.flatten(table)</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;Converts a table with multiple dimensions into a flat (one-dimensional) array while preserving the order of elements at the bottom level. The dimensions of the table do not need to be the same size. A caveat is that bottom-level elements cannot be tables, or they will be treated as if they were another dimension of the overall tree.
	<br>
	<b>Example:</b> <code>etc.flatten {a, {b, c}, {d, {e}}}</code> returns  <code>{a, b, c, d, e}</code>
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.merge</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.merge(first_table, ...)</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;Assuming all the arguments supplied as varargs (<code>...</code>) are tables, return a new table by merging all the supplied tables together with keys from latter-specified tables taking priority over those specified first. If <code>first_table</code> is the only argument, returns a copy of it. This function is not recursive. Sub-table elements of the tables being merged will not be merged.
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.merge_recursive</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.merge_recursive(first_table, ...)</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;Identical to <code>etc.merge</code> except that it will merge subtables up to any order. This function does NOT check for recursive definitions!
</p>

<p>
	<h2>PLACEHOLDER FUNCTIONS</h2>
	These functions are useful when calling a method or procedure that takes a function as an argument, but you don't want to pass any particular function to it.
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.NOP</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.NOP()</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;Does nothing; returns nothing.
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.ID</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.ID(...)</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;Does nothing; returns <code>...</code>.
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.INV</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.INV(a, b)</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;Does nothing; returns <code>b, a</code>.
</p>

<p>
	<h2>LOGGING FUNCTIONS</h2>
	This set of functions essentially act as a wrapper around <code>minetest.log</code> with the added capability of throwing fatal errors as part of logging procedure.
</p>

<h3>etc.log.fatal</h3>
<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.log.fatal(msg[, level])</code>
<br>
&emsp;Logs <code>msg</code> as-is accompanied by the modname, then raises an error with the same message. If <code>level</code> is set, adds it to the error level. Default error level is 2 (the function calling <code>etc.log.fatal</code>).
<br><br>

<h3>etc.log.assert</h3>
<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.log.assert(cond, msg)</code>
<br>
&emsp;If <code>cond</code> is not true, call <code>etc.log.fatal(msg, 1)</code>.
<br><br>

<h3>etc.log.error</h3>
<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.log.error(...)</code>
<br>
&emsp;Logs the result of concatenating <code>...</code> to a string with the log level <code>error</code>, along with the currently loading modname or <code>@active</code> if modloading has already finished.
<br><br>

<h3>etc.log.warn</h3>
<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.log.warn(...)</code>
<br>
&emsp;Logs the result of concatenating <code>...</code> to a string with the log level <code>warning</code>, along with the currently loading modname or <code>@active</code> if modloading has already finished.
<br><br>

<h3>etc.log.info</h3>
<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.log.info(...)</code>
<br>
&emsp;Logs the result of concatenating <code>...</code> to a string with the log level <code>info</code>, along with the currently loading modname or <code>@active</code> if modloading has already finished.
<br><br>

<h3>etc.log.action</h3>
<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.log.action(...)</code>
<br>
&emsp;Logs the result of concatenating <code>...</code> to a string with the log level <code>action</code>, along with the currently loading modname or <code>@active</code> if modloading has already finished.
<br><br>

<h3>etc.log.verbose</h3>
<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.log.verbose(...)</code>
<br>
&emsp;Logs the result of concatenating <code>...</code> to a string with the log level <code>verbose</code>, along with the currently loading modname or <code>@active</code> if modloading has already finished.
<br><br>

<h3>etc.log</h3>
<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.log(...)</code>
<br>
&emsp;Alias of <code>etc.log.info(...)</code>.
<br><br>
</p>

<p>
	<h2>COLOR HELPERS</h2>
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.rgb_to_hex</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.rgb_to_hex(r, g, b[, a])</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;Returns a hex string of the specified color. Uses 0-1 channels, so if your numbers are 0-255 you should divide by 255 first. The alpha channel is optional, and if specified will result in an <code>#RRGGBBAA</code> formatted string (the kind Minetest uses).
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.hex_to_rgb</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.hex_to_rgb(hex)</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;Returns red, green, blue, and optionally alpha channels in 0-1 space from the hexadecimal string provided. Only the <code>RRGGBB[AA]</code> format is supported. The hex code does not need to be preceded by a <code>#</code>, but is allowed to. <code>0x</code> notation is not supported.
</p>
