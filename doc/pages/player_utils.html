<h1> Player Utilities </h1>
<hr>
<p>
	These functions are helpful for dealing with player objects, and mostly cover gaps in the existing API.
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.get_player_range</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.get_player_range(player)</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;Returns the current interaction range of the <code>player</code>. This is calculated from the <code>range</code> property of either the player's wielded item or their hand. If neither are set, returns <code>4</code>.
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.get_player_pointed_thing</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.get_player_pointed_thing(player, objects, liquids)</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;Returns the current 'thing' the player is pointing at, using their current interaction range. <code>objects</code> and <code>liquids</code> are booleans; set them to determine if the player can point those things. The return value of this function will be equivalent to the <code>pointed_thing</code> provided in, for example, node callbacks.
</p>

<p>
	<h3>etc.set_player_look_dir</h3>
	<b>Usage:</b> <code>etc.set_player_look_dir(player, dir)</code>
	<br>
	&emsp;Rotate's the <code>player</code>'s camera to look in the direction specified by <code>dir</code>. The direction should be a vector denoting a point on the surface of a sphere, much like the one returned by <code>player: get_look_dir</code>. It does not need to be a unit vector; this function will normalize its' input.
